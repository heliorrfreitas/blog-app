    intro: "I am Helio Rui. I am from Brazil. I love learning about computers, programming, space exploration, reading mangas, playing games, soccer, and whatever else I find interesting. \n\nI have a bachelor of science in computer science. It was a long road, but I made it. During my road, I even got to study abroad. I was awarded with full sponsorship through the Brazilian government to study in a university from the United States. \n\nI have worked on lots of different projects like ERP systems, websites, Wordpress plugins, Wordpress themes, desktop applications, computer games, android apps, MacOS apps, and even in robotic projects. In addition, I have been working with web technologies for nearly 5 years at different companies, and I have been studying about computers for many more years than that. \n\nTo conclude, I am very interested in technology and problem solving.
